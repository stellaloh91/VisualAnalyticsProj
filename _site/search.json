In a bid to contain the spread, nations have implemented various measures, with most of these approaches centered on the role of an individual to practice proper hygiene such as proper use of soap to wash their hands to wearing masks.\r\nUnderstanding how perceptions and behaviours have changed in critical in determining the success of Covid-19 measures. The dataset used in this application was taken from the Imperial College London YouGov Covid 19 Behaviour Tracker Data Hub.\r\n\r\n\r\nObjectives\r\nThe team aims to create an interactive visualisation tool to enable exploratory data analysis to derive insights from the Covid 19 Behaviour data. Using this application, we aim to enable 1) Visualisation data of different levels of aggregation, with minimal technical knowledge required, 2) visualising trends and patterns among responses and 3) the ability to display detailed records on demand.\r\n\r\n\r\nApproach\r\nData Wrangling - Techniques such as the use of tidyverse was applied to the dataset to extract only the relevant information for the analysis from the large dataset consisting of 418 fields.\r\nData Preparation - Some of the complex fields were transformed into multiple columns to facilitate analysis and derive better insights. Specifically, the “region” data field contained both the region and town information and hence was split into the two separate columns respectively.\r\nData Exploration - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to explore the data using different variables and aggregation levels.\r\n\r\n\r\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\r\n\r\nBar Chart\r\nBar charts present categorical data using rectangular bars with lengths proportional to the values that they represent. They are effective in helping users compare individual values to one another.\r\nThey serve as a tool to visualize the proportion of the selected X to the selected Y variables.\r\nThe example below shows the proportion of respondents by age group and the frequency which they wear masks outside of their homes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLine Chart\r\nLine charts display information as a series of data points connected by straight line segments. They are effective in their ability to show trends and patterns of change. Users are able to select which variable they wish to visualize. Furthermore, the interactive line chart allows users to isolate the responses they wish to view. Users can mouseover the plot to see the detailed proportion. In the below selection on trust in the vaccine plotted against time, we observe that the responses were improving over time after Dec’20, with an increase in trend on the positive responses, reaching a high of 77% in Jul’21.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParallel Sets\r\nThe parallel sets shows the distribution between different categories at each level by displaying the flow-path. This application allows users to select between 3 to 5 levels of categories as well as the date range to filter the data.The width of the flow-path determines the density of the data which associates with the response in the category.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture Works\r\nGiven the rapidly evolving pandemic landscape, data quickly becomes irrelevant. Hence, data needs to be constantly refreshed and updated for newer responses. The stored survey data can be replaced with real-time updated survey responses collected for the most up to date analysis and exploration to stay ahead of the curve.\r\nThe scope of the application can also be extended to cover a larger geographic area to incorporate comparison across multiple countries.\r\nAdditional interactive features can be added to the application, including the option for the user to compare one chart view against another so as to make comparisons easier, as the human mind may not be able to retain earlier views in memory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

In a bid to contain the spread, nations have implemented various measures, with most of these approaches centered on the role of an individual to practice preventive behaviours. These measures range from being mandatory (requirement to wear masks once leaving the house) to those which are highly encouraged (proper handwashing). With the implementation of these approaches, daily behaviours as we know it have slowly evolved.\r\nUnderstanding how perceptions and behaviours have changed in critical in determining the success of Covid-19 measures. Afterall, it is not enforcement that will determine if measures introduced by the government succeed or fail, but the behaviour of the people. A common approach is to collect data from representative surveys, Most of these survey fieldwork and analysis are performed independently for various studies and tend to be on a smaller scale.\r\nDespite the effort and expense on such research initiatives, the real world practice of using these survey data tends to be confined to the particular study and bulk of the data collected is left untapped for insights. The charts presented in the analysis are typically confined to static charts which provide summarized information to the user. They tend to be highly aggregated with the granular details presented in supplementary charts. Moreover, these reports tend to use generic templates and ignore several best practices in statistical analysis and data visualization. This may be due to a lack of ability of non-analytics professionals to engage with data.\r\nMotivation & Objective\r\nThis research and development is motivated by the lack of easy to use interactive tools for non-technical users to visualize the data collected and perform analysis on them. Hence this tools aims to fill this gap so as to allow these users such as a government Covid-19 taskforce practitioner to i) maximise the usage of the survey data collected, ii) be self-reliant in generating insights from this data. We have identified that one of the main difficulties these non-technical users face when attempting to generate such insights and visualizations independently is that they may not know how to update the codes to generate alternative views or to achieve visualizations of various levels of aggregation. The tool was thus aimed to support the following requirements:\r\nVisualize data of different levels of aggregation, with minimal technical knowledge required\r\nVisualize trends and patterns among responses\r\nAbility to display detailed records on-demand\r\nData Source\r\nThe data was collected by YouGov in partnership with the Institute of Global Health Innovation (IGHI) at Imperial College London to gather global insights on people’s behaviours in response to COVID-19.\r\nMethodology & Approach\r\nWe have brainstormed on the following visualizations to be included in the application:\r\nBar Charts\r\nBar charts present categorical data with rectangular bars with lengths proportional to the values that they represent. They are effective in helping the user compare individual values to one another. To help the user visualize the variability of data, we have also added an option to include 95% confidence error bars into the visualization.\r\nExample 1: Example of bar charts with error barsLine Charts\r\nLine charts display information as a series of data points connected by straight line segments. They are effective in their ability to show trends and patterns of change.\r\nExample 2: Example of line chartsParallel Sets\r\nParallel Sets is a visualization method which allows interactive exploration of categorical data that shows data frequencies instead of the individual data points. The method is based on the axis layout of parallel coordinates, with boxes representing the categories and parallelograms between the axes showing the relations between categories.\r\nTimeline\r\nTasks Name\r\nStart Date (DD/MM/YY)\r\nEnd Date (DD/MM/YY)\r\nAssigned To\r\n% Completion\r\nFormulate Project details\r\n05/06/21\r\n08/06/21\r\nAll\r\n100%\r\nProject consultation with Prof\r\n11/06/21\r\n11/06/21\r\nAll\r\n100%\r\nRefine project scope and ideas\r\n12/06/21\r\n20/06/21\r\nAll\r\n100%\r\nComplete project proposal and publish on Netlify page\r\n12/06/21\r\n20/06/21\r\nAll\r\n100%\r\nData Preparation\r\n21/06/21\r\n30/06/21\r\nAll\r\n100%\r\nDraft Application Features\r\n18/07/21\r\n23/07/21\r\nAll\r\n100%\r\nCreation of application on R Shiny\r\n24/07/21\r\n31/07/21\r\nAll\r\n100%\r\nDraft Poster Design\r\n25/07/21\r\n31/07/21\r\nAll\r\n100%\r\nApplication refinement\r\n01/08/2021\r\n14/08/21\r\nAll\r\n100%\r\nDraft final report, including user guide\r\n01/08/2021\r\n14/08/21\r\nAll\r\n100%\r\nFinalise artifact\r\n01/08/2021\r\n14/08/21\r\nAll\r\n100%\r\nUpdate Netlify\r\n09/08/2021\r\n14/08/21\r\nAll\r\n100%\r\nSubmission of final application, user guide, project poster, research paper and artifacts\r\n15/08/21\r\n15/08/21\r\nAll\r\n100%\r\nPackages\r\nPackage\r\nDescription\r\nShinydashboard\r\nInteractive web applications for data visualization\r\nShiny\r\nInteractive web applications for data visualization\r\nTidyverse\r\nData manipulation\r\nLeaflet\r\nCreate maps within the application\r\nDplyr\r\nData manipulation\r\nSf\r\nCreate maps within the application\r\nggplot2\r\nPlot visualizations and EDA\r\nPlotly\r\nPlot interactive visualizations\r\nShinythemes\r\nSelect themes for Shiny application\r\nmclust\r\nPerform Latent Class Analysis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
